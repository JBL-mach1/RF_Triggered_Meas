# RF_triggered_meas
This project will define a measurement system capable of data-logging on board a Feather 32u4 triggered from a packet radio transmission.

ATmega32u4 Feather RF9X will send and receive data to initiate record sequence. Receiving modules, built with the Feather 32u4 Data Logger and the Feather RF9X hat, will begin to record data through analog pins and store on board to a microSD
